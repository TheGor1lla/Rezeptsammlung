# Bad Ass Beans And Rice

## Ingredients:

* Red pepper, red onion, red tomato, all diced

* 3 TBSP cooking oil - olive, vegetable, baby, whatever

* 2 to 12 garlic cloves, depending on your level of bravery, and if you'll have to talk to another human being in the next 48 hours. I telecommute, so I can eat a whole head of garlic if I want. You can't stop me.

* 1 can of black beans

* 2 tbsp oregano

* 2 tbsp cumin

* 1/4 to 1 tsp cayenne pepper, or 1 finely chopped jalapeno.

* 1 tbsp lime juice

* 2 cups rice

* 3 cups chicken broth

## Cooking:

Cook the rice in the chicken broth. Sometimes I'll boil some eggs in there, too, to make egg salad the next day.

Take the onion and pepper, and crush the garlic, and throw them in the pot with the oil. Cook them in the oil until the onion is shiny.

Add the cooked rice and all the other shit, except for the lime juice. Simmer for 20 minutes or until your wife gets home and asks if dinner is ready, whichever is first.

Once everything is done, add the lime juice. Salt and pepper to taste.

Guacamole, salsa, sour cream, etc., are all good additions. Also, it's a good idea to have cheese and tortillas on hand to turn the leftovers into burritos.

Also, if you've got time, roasting a head of garlic in the oven gives it a milder, sweeter taste, which is a nice change. Just chop off a bit of the non-stem end, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in tin foil, and stick in the oven for an hour on about 350. Makes the kitchen smell great. Amazing on toast, too.
